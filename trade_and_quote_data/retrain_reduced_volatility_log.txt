🔧 RETRAINING WITH REDUCED VOLATILITY WEIGHTING
================================================================================

Strategy:
  1. Scale down volatility features by 0.5x
  2. Create interaction features (volatility * price momentum)
  3. Add trend confirmation features
  4. Retrain with adjusted feature set
