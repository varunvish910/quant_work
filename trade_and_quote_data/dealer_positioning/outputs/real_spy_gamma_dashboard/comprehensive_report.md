## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk Factors

**Gamma Risk:** High

- **Implication:** High acceleration risk on directional moves

**Vanna Risk:** High
- Net exposure: -491,586

**Pin Risk:** High
- ATM gamma concentration: 1,537,309
- **Implication:** Strong expiration effects expected

### Stress Scenarios
1. **Upside Break:** High gamma zones may provide resistance, but negative gamma above could accelerate moves
2. **Downside Break:** Positive gamma support levels could provide bounce opportunities
3. **Volatility Spike:** Vanna effects could amplify or dampen spot moves depending on positioning
4. **Time Decay:** Charm exposure suggests [acceleration/deceleration] of delta changes approaching expiration

## Trading Implications

### Strategic Recommendations
1. Expect price consolidation between 500 and 683
2. Consider short vol strategies or range-bound plays
3. Key resistance at 683 from negative gamma
4. Key support at 500 from positive gamma
5. WARNING: High gamma exposure - expect accelerated moves
6. WARNING: High vanna exposure - vol/spot correlation risk

### Regime-Specific Strategies (Pinning)
- **Iron Condor/Butterfly:** Sell volatility in expected range
- **Time Decay Plays:** Theta strategies likely profitable
