🎯 HEDGE SIGNAL VS DEFENSE ANALYSIS
==================================================

❓ KEY QUESTION:
Does hedging data predict 'market will pull back'?
OR does it just show 'if pullback happens, X level is defended'?

📊 SIGNAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS:
  • Prediction signals: 0.0% of days
  • Defense signals: 0.0% of days

⚠️  CONCLUSION: More PREDICTION signals than DEFENSE signals
   → Data may predict pullbacks
🏛️  INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING:
  • Average institutional ratio: 80.1%
  • High institutional days: 55.9%

✅ High institutional dominance = DEFENSE positioning
   → Institutions are hedging, not predicting
🎯 FINAL ANSWER:
--------------------
⚠️  The data shows some PREDICTION signals

What it tells us:
• Some institutional positioning may predict pullbacks
• Defense levels are still the primary signal
• Mixed prediction/defense signals
