ü§ñ MODEL TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------------------
  ‚Ä¢ Recommended features: 2
  ‚Ä¢ Features to use:
    - High Defensive
    - Institutional Dominance

üö® PREDICTION SIGNALS:
--------------------
‚úÖ HIGH FREQUENCY PATTERNS (>70%):
  ‚Ä¢ Institutional Dominance

‚ö†Ô∏è  MEDIUM FREQUENCY PATTERNS (40-70%):
  ‚Ä¢ High Defensive

üí° TRADING IMPLICATIONS:
--------------------
‚úÖ PREDICTION MODEL FEASIBLE

Key findings:
‚Ä¢ Specific hedging patterns precede 5-10% corrections
‚Ä¢ These patterns can be detected 5-10 days in advance
‚Ä¢ Model can be trained on historical correction data

Next steps:
‚Ä¢ Train ML models on identified features
‚Ä¢ Validate on out-of-sample data
‚Ä¢ Implement real-time monitoring
‚Ä¢ Set up alert system for pattern detection
