# Early Warning Model Improvement Roadmap

## Current Status (Regularized Model)
- **ROC AUC**: 65.8%
- **Precision**: 57.6% (when it signals, 58% are correct)
- **Recall**: 32.8% (catches only 33% of actual pullbacks)
- **False Positive Rate**: 7.4%

**Key Issue**: Model is too conservative - it misses 67% of actual pullbacks.

## Phase 1: Feature Engineering Improvements (High Impact)

### 1.1 Add Market Microstructure Features
**Goal**: Capture early warning signs of institutional positioning changes

Features to add:
- **Intraday volatility patterns**: Open-to-close vs high-low range ratios
- **Gap analysis**: Overnight gaps as early warning signals
- **Volume profile**: Unusual volume at specific price levels
- **Bid-ask spread widening**: Liquidity deterioration signals

**Expected Impact**: +3-5% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Medium (need intraday data from yfinance)

### 1.2 Add Sentiment & Positioning Features
**Goal**: Capture market psychology and crowding

Features to add:
- **VIX futures term structure**: Contango/backwardation steepness
- **Put/Call ratio changes**: Rate of change, not just levels
- **Skew acceleration**: Second derivative of IV skew
- **Dealer gamma positioning**: Estimate from options data
- **AAII sentiment**: Contrarian indicator (if available)

**Expected Impact**: +2-4% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Medium (need to calculate from existing options data)

### 1.3 Add Cross-Asset Correlation Features
**Goal**: Detect regime shifts across asset classes

Features to add:
- **SPY-TLT correlation**: Flight-to-safety detection
- **SPY-Gold correlation**: Risk-off behavior
- **Currency basket strength**: DXY momentum + USDJPY momentum
- **Credit spreads**: HYG-LQD spread widening (if available)
- **Commodity momentum**: Oil, copper as economic indicators

**Expected Impact**: +2-3% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Low (just need to download TLT, GLD, HYG, LQD)

### 1.4 Add Cycle & Seasonality Features
**Goal**: Capture recurring market patterns

Features to add:
- **Presidential cycle**: Year in 4-year cycle (1-4)
- **Seasonal patterns**: Month-of-year effects

**Expected Impact**: +1-2% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Low (mostly calendar-based features)

---

## Phase 2: Target Refinement (Medium Impact)

### 2.1 Multi-Horizon Targets
**Goal**: Predict pullbacks at multiple time horizons

Current: 2%+ in 3-5 days
Add:
- **Near-term**: 2%+ in 1-3 days (crash warning)
- **Medium-term**: 3%+ in 5-10 days (pullback warning)
- **Extended**: 4%+ in 10-20 days (correction warning)

Train separate models for each horizon, then ensemble.

**Expected Impact**: +3-5% ROC AUC (via ensemble)
**Effort**: Medium

### 2.2 Severity Classification
**Goal**: Predict not just IF but HOW MUCH

Instead of binary (pullback/no pullback), predict:
- **Minor**: 2-3% pullback
- **Moderate**: 3-5% pullback
- **Major**: 5%+ pullback

Use multi-class classification or regression.

**Expected Impact**: +2-4% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Medium

### 2.3 Adaptive Target Window
**Goal**: Account for market regime in target definition

In high volatility: Use shorter windows (3-5 days)
In low volatility: Use longer windows (5-10 days)

**Expected Impact**: +1-2% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Low

2. **XGBoost** (different boosting algorithm)
3. **Random Forest** (bagging approach)
4. **Logistic Regression** (linear baseline)
5. **Neural Network** (non-linear patterns)

Use weighted voting or stacking.

**Expected Impact**: +3-5% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Medium

### 3.2 Time-Series Cross-Validation
**Goal**: More robust hyperparameter tuning

Current: Single train/val/test split
Improve: Walk-forward cross-validation with multiple folds

**Expected Impact**: +2-3% ROC AUC (more stable)
**Effort**: Medium

### 3.3 Feature Selection & Interaction Terms
**Goal**: Remove noise, add signal

- **Recursive feature elimination**: Remove low-importance features
- **Feature interactions**: VIX * RSI, BB_width * momentum, etc.
- **Polynomial features**: Quadratic terms for non-linear relationships

**Expected Impact**: +2-4% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Medium

---

## Phase 4: Class Imbalance Handling (High Impact for Recall)

### 4.1 Advanced Sampling Techniques
**Goal**: Improve recall without sacrificing precision

Current: `is_unbalance=True` in LightGBM
Improve:
- **SMOTE**: Synthetic minority oversampling
- **ADASYN**: Adaptive synthetic sampling
- **Tomek links**: Remove noisy majority samples
- **Cost-sensitive learning**: Penalize false negatives more

**Expected Impact**: +5-10% Recall (may reduce precision slightly)
**Effort**: Low

### 4.2 Threshold Optimization
**Goal**: Find optimal probability threshold for trading

Current: 50% threshold
Optimize: Find threshold that maximizes F1 or custom metric

**Expected Impact**: +3-5% F1 Score
**Effort**: Low

### 4.3 Calibration
**Goal**: Make probabilities more reliable

- **Platt scaling**: Logistic calibration
- **Isotonic regression**: Non-parametric calibration
- **Beta calibration**: More flexible than Platt

**Expected Impact**: Better probability estimates
**Effort**: Low

## Phase 5: Data Quality & Quantity (High Impact)

### 5.1 Extend Training Data

Improve:
- Use proxy features for pre-2016 (when options data unavailable)
- Focus on 2008, 2020 crashes for rare event learning
- Oversample crisis periods

**Expected Impact**: +2-4% ROC AUC
**Effort**: Low

### 5.2 Add Alternative Data Sources
**Goal**: Unique signals not in price/volume

Potential sources:
- **Google Trends**: Search volume for "market crash", "recession"
- **News sentiment**: Financial news NLP (if available)
- **Social media**: Twitter/Reddit sentiment (if available)
- **Economic indicators**: Yield curve, unemployment, PMI

**Expected Impact**: +3-5% ROC AUC
**Effort**: High (data acquisition)

**Expected Impact**: Real-world validation
**Effort**: Medium

### 6.3 Regime-Aware Predictions
