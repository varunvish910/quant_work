# 🚀 Making Gradual Decline Analyzer Operational

## ✅ Status: Ready to Train

All infrastructure is complete. Follow these steps to make it fully operational:

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
# Optional: Install LightGBM for better performance
pip install lightgbm

# Or use sklearn (already available) as fallback
```

## Step 2: Train the Models

```bash
cd /Users/varun/code/quant_final_final/trade_and_quote_data
python3 train_gradual_decline_model.py
```

This will:
1. Load SPY data from 2000-2024
2. Calculate 90+ gradual decline features
3. Create targets for 7, 14, 20, 30-day windows
4. Train 4 models (one per timeframe)
5. Save trained models to `models/gradual_decline_ensemble/`
6. Evaluate on 2024 test data
7. Check if April 2024 gradual decline was caught

**Expected output:**
- Training time: ~5-10 minutes
- Models saved to: `models/gradual_decline_ensemble/`
- Test evaluation on 2024 data
- April 2024 detection analysis

## Step 3: Use the Trained Models

### Quick Usage
```python
from gradual_decline_analyzer import GradualDeclineDetector
import yfinance as yf

# Load recent data
spy = yf.download('SPY', start='2024-10-01', end='2024-12-31')

# Initialize detector (auto-loads trained models)
detector = GradualDeclineDetector(model_dir='models/gradual_decline_ensemble')

# Get risk assessment
risk = detector.detect_decline_risk(spy)

print(f"Composite Risk: {risk['composite_risk']:.1%}")
print(f"Risk Level: {risk['risk_level']}")
print(f"Recommendation: {risk['recommended_action']}")
```

### Detailed Predictions
```python
from gradual_decline_analyzer.models import GradualDeclineEnsemble

# Load ensemble
ensemble = GradualDeclineEnsemble.load('models/gradual_decline_ensemble')

# Get all timeframe predictions
predictions = ensemble.get_all_predictions(features)
print(predictions)
#   7d_prob  14d_prob  20d_prob  30d_prob  ensemble_prob  ensemble_pred
# 0   0.35     0.42      0.48      0.31       0.41            0
```

## Step 4: Integration with Crash Detector

### Unified Risk Assessment
```python
# Combined risk from both systems
from crash_risk_buildup import analyze as analyze_crash
from gradual_decline_analyzer import GradualDeclineDetector

# Get both assessments
crash_risk = analyze_crash(spy_data)
gradual_detector = GradualDeclineDetector(model_dir='models/gradual_decline_ensemble')
gradual_risk = gradual_detector.detect_decline_risk(spy_data)

# Unified decision
if crash_risk['probability'] > 0.6:
    print("🚨 IMMEDIATE: Sudden crash likely (3-7 days)")
    print("   Action: Reduce exposure immediately")
elif gradual_risk['composite_risk'] > 0.6:
    print("⚠️  GRADUAL: Slow decline likely (7-30 days)")
    print("   Action: Monitor and reduce exposure gradually")
elif crash_risk['probability'] > 0.4 or gradual_risk['composite_risk'] > 0.4:
    print("📊 ELEVATED: Increased risk detected")
    print("   Action: Set stops and monitor closely")
else:
    print("✅ NORMAL: No significant risk")
```

## Step 5: Add to Main CLI (Optional)

Update `main.py` to include gradual decline detection:

```python
# In main.py, add new command

@click.command()
@click.option('--type', type=click.Choice(['crash', 'gradual', 'both']), default='both')
def analyze_risk(type):
    """Analyze market risk"""
    
    # Load data
    spy = load_recent_spy_data()
    
    if type in ['crash', 'both']:
        # Crash risk analysis
        crash_risk = analyze_crash(spy)
        print(f"Crash Risk: {crash_risk['probability']:.1%}")
    
    if type in ['gradual', 'both']:
        # Gradual decline analysis
        detector = GradualDeclineDetector(model_dir='models/gradual_decline_ensemble')
        gradual_risk = detector.detect_decline_risk(spy)
        print(f"Gradual Risk: {gradual_risk['composite_risk']:.1%}")
```

## What Gets Created

After training, you'll have:

```
models/gradual_decline_ensemble/
├── model_7d.pkl                 # 7-day model
├── model_14d.pkl                # 14-day model
├── model_20d.pkl                # 20-day model (primary)
├── model_30d.pkl                # 30-day model
├── metadata_7d.pkl              # Model metadata
├── metadata_14d.pkl
├── metadata_20d.pkl
├── metadata_30d.pkl
├── feature_importance_7d.csv    # Feature rankings
├── feature_importance_14d.csv
├── feature_importance_20d.csv
├── feature_importance_30d.csv
└── ensemble_metadata.pkl        # Ensemble config
```

## Expected Performance

Based on feature design:

### On Gradual Declines (7-40 days)
- **Recall**: 60-70% (vs 35% with crash detector)
- **Precision**: 20-30%
- **Lead Time**: 5-10 days advance warning

### On April 2024 Specifically
- **Should detect**: ✅ (18-day gradual decline)
- **Features that trigger**:
  - Negative price slopes for 15+ days
  - RSI declining below 50
  - Lower highs pattern
  - Volume divergence

### On July 2024 (Sudden Crash)
- **Gradual detector**: May not trigger (too sudden)
- **Crash detector**: ✅ Already caught (63.5% confidence, 7 days early)

## Feature Importance (Expected)

Top features for gradual decline detection:

1. **price_slope_20d** (~15%) - Most predictive
2. **rsi_slope_10d** (~12%) - Momentum decay
3. **days_since_peak** (~8%) - Time-based risk
4. **obv_price_divergence** (~7%) - Smart money exiting
5. **negative_slope_ratio_20d** (~6%) - Trend persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Models not training
**Solution**: Check data availability and feature calculation

### Issue: Low performance on test set
**Solution**: May need feature selection or hyperparameter tuning

### Issue: April 2024 not detected
**Solution**: Check if features properly capture gradual patterns

## Next Steps After Training

1. **Validate April 2024**: Ensure it catches the gradual decline
2. **Backtest 2018 Q4**: Test on another gradual bear market
3. **Backtest 2022 H1**: Test on gradual decline period
4. **Fine-tune thresholds**: Adjust based on false positive rate
5. **Monitor live**: Use on current market data

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Train models
python3 train_gradual_decline_model.py

# Test on current market
python3 -c "
from gradual_decline_analyzer import GradualDeclineDetector
import yfinance as yf
spy = yf.download('SPY', start='2024-10-01', end='2024-12-31')
detector = GradualDeclineDetector(model_dir='models/gradual_decline_ensemble')
risk = detector.detect_decline_risk(spy)
print(f'Risk: {risk[\"composite_risk\"]:.1%} ({risk[\"risk_level\"]})')
"
```

## Summary

**Current Status**: ✅ Ready to train
**Time to Operational**: ~10 minutes (just run training script)
**Expected Outcome**: Models that catch gradual declines like April 2024

Run `python3 train_gradual_decline_model.py` to make it fully operational!
