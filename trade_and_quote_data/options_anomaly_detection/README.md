### Key Metrics Explained

#### **Anomaly Detection Results**
- **Total contracts**: Number of option contracts analyzed
- **Anomalies detected**: Number and percentage of unusual contracts
- **High confidence**: Number of highly reliable anomalies

#### **Trading Signals**
- **Direction**: 
  - `bearish` = Puts more active than calls (bearish sentiment)
  - `bullish` = Calls more active than puts (bullish sentiment)
  - `neutral` = Balanced activity
- **Strength**: How strong the signal is (0-1, higher = stronger)
- **Confidence**: How reliable the signal is (0-1, higher = more reliable)
- **Quality**: 
  - `high` = Very reliable signal (>80% confidence)
  - `medium` = Moderately reliable (50-80% confidence)
  - `low` = Weak signal (<50% confidence)

#### **Detection Methods Breakdown**
```
📊 DETECTION METHODS:
  • isolation_forest    :  349 anomalies (10.0%)
  • one_class_svm       :  349 anomalies (10.0%)
  • dbscan              :  378 anomalies (10.8%)
  • zscore              :    0 anomalies (0.0%)
  • iqr                 : 1330 anomalies (38.1%)
```

- **Isolation Forest**: Good at finding isolated outliers
- **One-Class SVM**: Good at finding boundary outliers
- **DBSCAN**: Good at finding density-based outliers
- **Z-Score**: Very strict, only extreme outliers
- **IQR**: More sensitive, catches more patterns

## 🎯 How to Interpret Results

### **Anomaly Rate Interpretation**
- **7-9%**: Normal market conditions
- **10-15%**: Elevated unusual activity
- **15%+**: High stress or major events

### **Signal Quality Guide**
- **High Quality + High Confidence**: Strong trading signal
- **Medium Quality + High Confidence**: Good trading signal
- **Low Quality**: Weak signal, use with caution

### **Direction Signals**
- **Bearish Signal**: 
  - Puts more active than calls
  - May indicate hedging, speculation, or market stress
  - Consider defensive positions or put strategies
- **Bullish Signal**:
  - Calls more active than puts
  - May indicate optimism or call buying
  - Consider bullish strategies

### **Practical Trading Applications**

#### **Risk Management**
- High anomaly rates = increased market stress
- Use for position sizing and risk assessment
- Monitor for potential market disruptions

#### **Entry/Exit Timing**
- High-confidence signals = good timing opportunities
- Combine with technical analysis for confirmation
- Use for option strategy selection

#### **Market Regime Detection**
- Consistent bearish signals = defensive market
- Consistent bullish signals = risk-on market
- Mixed signals = uncertain market conditions

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### **Custom Analysis**
```python
from feature_engineering import OptionsFeatureEngine
from anomaly_detection import OptionsAnomalyDetector

# Load data
df = pd.read_parquet('data/options_chains/SPY/2024/01/SPY_options_snapshot_20240109.parquet')
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime('2024-01-09')

# Process features
fe = OptionsFeatureEngine()
df_processed = fe.calculate_oi_features(df)
# ... add other feature calculations

# Detect anomalies
detector = OptionsAnomalyDetector()
features = detector.prepare_features(df_processed)
detector.fit_models(features)
anomaly_results = detector.ensemble_detection(features)
```

# Analyze multiple dates
dates = ['20240109', '20240110', '20240111']
for date in dates:
    result = analyze_date(date)
    print(f"Date: {date}, Anomaly Rate: {result['anomaly_rate']:.1%}")
