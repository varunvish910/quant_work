- 🔄 **Training in progress (background)**

---

## 🔄 Currently Running

**Process:** Model training with all features  
**PID:** Check `training.pid` file  
**Log:** `training_output.log`  
**Estimated time:** 30-60 minutes

### Monitor Progress:
```bash
tail -f training_output.log
```

### Check if still running:
```bash
ps -p $(cat training.pid) > /dev/null && echo "✅ Still running" || echo "✅ Completed"
```

### View results when done:
```bash
cat training_output.log
ls -lh models/trained/
```

- `data/volatility/*.parquet` (3 indices)

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Performance Target:
- **Current ROC AUC:** 64%
- **Target ROC AUC:** 70%+
- **Expected improvement:** 3-6% from new features

### Feature Impact:
- Rotation indicators: +2-3% (concentration risk detection)
- Volume features: +1-2% (volume-price divergence)
- Trend features: +1-2% (trend strength)

---

## ✅ When Training Completes

You'll have:

1. **Enhanced Models:**
   - `early_warning_ensemble_YYYYMMDD.pkl`
   - `mean_reversion_ensemble_YYYYMMDD.pkl`
   - Performance metrics for each

2. **Performance Comparison:**
   - ROC AUC for each model
   - Precision/Recall metrics
   - Feature importance rankings

3. **Ready for Phase 4:**
   - All features integrated
   - Models trained and validated
   - Ready to build trading strategies

---

## 📝 Next Steps (After Training)

### Immediate:
1. Check training results:
   ```bash
   cat training_output.log
   ```

2. Test predictions:
   ```bash
   python3 daily_usage_example.py
   ```

3. Compare models:
   ```bash
   ls -lh models/trained/
   ```

### Phase 4 (Backtesting):
1. Create position sizing strategies
2. Implement hedging logic
3. Build backtesting framework
4. Test strategies on historical data
5. Optimize parameters
6. Generate performance reports

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Training fails:
```bash
# Check error
cat training_output.log

# Kill process
kill $(cat training.pid)

# Restart
python3 train_with_all_features.py
```

### Out of memory:
- Reduce date range in script
- Use smaller model (reduce n_estimators)
- Train one target at a time

### Import errors:
- Check all feature files exist
- Verify engines are updated
- Run: `python3 -c "from engines.technical_engine import TechnicalFeatureEngine"`
