  - None: 48.9%
  - Minor: 20.7%
  - Moderate: 19.1%

### 3. ✅ Cluster Detection
- **Added**: `is_cluster_start` feature
- **Impact**: Identifies first signal in a cluster (397 clusters vs 3202 total signals)
- **Benefit**: Reduces noise, focuses on cluster starts

### 4. ✅ Seasonality Features (26 new features)
- Presidential cycle (year 1-4)
- Month effects (January, September, October, December)
- Quarter effects (Q3 most volatile)
- Options expiration (OpEx) cycles
- Earnings season proximity
- Turn-of-month effects
- Holiday season

### 5. ✅ Cross-Asset Features (13 new features)
- SPY-TLT correlation (flight to safety)
- SPY-GLD correlation (risk-off behavior)
- TLT momentum (bond strength)
- GLD momentum (gold strength)
- Risk regime composite
- Defensive assets outperformance

### 6. ✅ SMOTE for Class Balance
- **Before**: 51.8% positive samples (imbalanced)
- **After**: 50.0% positive samples (balanced)
- **Impact**: Model sees more examples of pullbacks

### 7. ✅ Threshold Optimization
- **Tested**: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7
- **Optimal**: 0.6 (F1: 61.9%)
- **Impact**: Better precision-recall tradeoff

## Feature Importance (Top 10)

1. **vix_momentum_3d**: 534 (VIX rate of change)
2. **volatility_20d**: 324 (Realized volatility)
3. **vix_level**: 293 (VIX absolute level)
4. **adx**: 203 (Trend strength)
5. **macd_signal**: 181 (Momentum signal)
6. **atr_14**: 179 (Average True Range)
7. **price_vs_sma50**: 176 (Price vs 50-day MA)
8. **days_to_quarter_end**: 151 (Seasonality - earnings)
9. **bb_width_percentile**: 140 (Volatility regime)
10. **macd**: 139 (Momentum)

**Key Insight**: VIX momentum (rate of change) is more important than VIX level alone. This aligns with the observation that **sudden spikes in fear** are better predictors than **high fear levels**.

## What We Learned

### 1. Clustering Matters
- 25 total pullback events in 2024
- But only 4 major clusters
- **We don't need to catch every day, just the first signal in each cluster**

### 2. Lead Time Reality
- Many events show 7-8 days lead time, not 3-5
- Expanding window to 3-7 days improved performance

### 3. Seasonality Is Real
- Q3 is most volatile (11 events)
- Days to quarter-end is 8th most important feature
- OpEx cycles matter

### 4. Cross-Asset Signals Work
- SPY-TLT correlation (flight to safety) is important
- TLT and GLD momentum add predictive power
- Risk regime composite helps

### 5. Recall > Precision for Early Warning
- Better to have false alarms than miss a crash
- 69.1% recall means we catch most major events
- 56% precision is acceptable (better than coin flip)

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. ✅ **DONE**: Expand target window (3-7 days)
2. ✅ **DONE**: Add seasonality features
3. ✅ **DONE**: Add cross-asset features
4. ✅ **DONE**: Apply SMOTE for class balance
5. ✅ **DONE**: Test on 2024 critical clusters

### Short-Term (1-2 weeks)
6. **Generate 2025 predictions** with improved model
7. **Compare models side-by-side** (visualization)
8. **Implement ensemble** (LightGBM + XGBoost + Random Forest)
9. **Add SHAP analysis** for interpretability
10. **Build backtesting framework** (Sharpe, max DD, win rate)

### Medium-Term (2-4 weeks)
11. **Add microstructure features** (intraday volatility, gaps)
12. **Add sentiment features** (dealer gamma, skew acceleration)
13. **Implement walk-forward CV** for robust hyperparameters
14. **Regime-aware ensemble** (separate models for bull/bear/sideways)

### Long-Term (1-2 months)
15. **Alternative data** (Google Trends, news sentiment)
16. **Real-time pipeline** (daily retraining, monitoring)
17. **Production deployment** (API, dashboard, alerts)
